# What I Learned In Week 2

### Intro to CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language that describes the style of an HTML document.
* we learned how to link external CSS with HTML with the following link:
  * `<link rel=”stylesheet” type=”text/css” href=“style.css”/>`
* Your CSS style goes inside the style tag, and always on inside the head tags
* CSS properties are set with a property and value.
  * `font-size: 40px;`
* CSS rules are written by indicating a selector.
  * The three selector types are tag, .class, and #id's.
* A few selector combinations are:
  * Apply to all - h1, div, p
  * Apply to descendants: div p
  * Apply to direct descendants: div > p

### Ugly-Webby
This was our first CSS project. Instead of trying to a website look nice, we had to play around and mess it up.
